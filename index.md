## Research Interests

My research interests focus on the security of modern software delivery
pipelines, particularly in settings where the execution environment cannot be
fully trusted.

Key areas of interest include:
- secure execution of CI/CD pipelines,
- software supply-chain security,
- trusted execution environments (TEEs),
- formal methods for reasoning about security properties.

## Current Work

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science, investigating how to provide
meaningful confidentiality and integrity guarantees for CI/CD pipelines executed
under hostile infrastructure assumptions.

My work combines system architecture design, formal modeling, and experimental
evaluation to study the trade-offs between security guarantees, performance
overhead, and practicality in real-world CI/CD environments.
