## Research Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of programming languages, formal methods, and secure and dependable systems, grounded in systems security and cryptography.

I am particularly interested in:
- formal verification of security, correctness, and reliability properties,
- programming languages, compiler-level abstractions, and semantics,
- functional programming and verification-oriented design,
- cryptographic and system-level mechanisms for building trustworthy systems.

Currently, my work applies these interests to the problem of secure execution in modern CI/CD pipelines, where untrusted infrastructure, automation, and software supply-chain risks intersect.

## Current Work

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science, investigating how to provide meaningful confidentiality and integrity guarantees for CI/CD pipelines executed under hostile infrastructure assumptions.

My work combines system architecture design, formal modeling, and experimental evaluation to study the trade-offs between security guarantees, performance overhead, and practicality in real-world CI/CD environments.
